What should effect be able to do early on
Affect different ways:
- Effect single target
- Effect multiple targets, If multiple you can make a circle UI overlay to see selected affected units
- Effect it self


- Change values of effected units: health, speed, defence

- An effect should be able to deal more damage to certain type of units


What should the Constitution class entail:
- Health
- Speed
- Defence (when taking damage, a defence modifyer is applied)
- 

Unit types: (One unit can have mulitple: Like flying and light)
- (has to be relevant in terms of which effect can hit it. ranged/melee doesnt make sense then...)
- Light (Small units)
- Armored (Units with lots of defence)
- Magic (Typically units that have mulitple abbilites and can have many roles)
- Flying
- Ground
